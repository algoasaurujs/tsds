# ****Introduction****

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. No single data structure works well for all purposes, and so it is important to know the strengths and limitations of several of them.

You may have used `Map` before, The `Map` object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

The `Map` is similar to `Object` But, The keys in `Map` are ordered in a simple, straightforward way: A `Map` object iterates entries, keys, and values in the order of entry insertion.

The `Map` is builtin in javascript but, There are lots of other useful Data Structures that are not implemented in JavaScript or TypeScript. We attempt to implement them in this library.
