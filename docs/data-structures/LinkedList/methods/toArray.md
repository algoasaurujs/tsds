# **LinkedList&lt;T&gt;.toArray**

This implementation returns an array containing all the elements
returned by this collection's iterator, in the same order, stored in
consecutive elements of the array, starting with index `0`.
The length of the returned array is equal to the number of elements
returned by the iterator, even if the size of this collection changes
during iteration, as might happen if the collection permits
concurrent modification during iteration. The `length` property is
called only as an optimization hint; the correct result is returned
even if the iterator returns a different number of elements.
