/**
 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the <tt>Collection</tt>
 * interface, to minimize the effort required to implement this interface. <p>
 *
 * To implement an unmodifiable collection, the programmer needs only to
 * extend this class and provide implementations for the <tt>iterator</tt> and
 * <tt>size</tt> methods.  (The iterator returned by the <tt>iterator</tt>
 * method must implement <tt>hasNext</tt> and <tt>next</tt>.)<p>
 *
 * To implement a modifiable collection, the programmer must additionally
 * override this class's <tt>add</tt> method (which otherwise throws an
 * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>), and the iterator returned by the
 * <tt>iterator</tt> method must additionally implement its <tt>remove</tt>
 * method.<p>
 *
 * The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and
 * <tt>Collection</tt> constructor, as per the recommendation in the
 * <tt>Collection</tt> interface specification.<p>
 *
 * The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its
 * implementation in detail.  Each of these methods may be overridden if
 * the collection being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.<p>
 *
 * This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
